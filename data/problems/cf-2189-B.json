  "description": "On an infinite number line at point 0, sits a frog. After many years of meditation, the frog has mastered n unique types of magical jumps. The i-th type of jump allows it to jump forward by no more than a[i] units. In other words, if it was at integer point k, after the jump it can land at any integer point from k to k + a[i].\n\nBut magic always comes with a price; it has been cursed. Before each b[i]-th attempt (before the b[i]-th, 2·b[i]-th, 3·b[i]-th, etc. attempt among the jumps of type i) to use the i-th type of jump, the frog rolls back c[i] units! In other words, if it was at point k, it will first find itself at point k - c[i], and after the jump, it can land at any integer point from k - c[i] to k - c[i] + a[i].\n\nThe frog's goal is to reach the point with the number x, using jumps while minimizing the number of rollbacks. Help the frog — find the minimum number of rollbacks it will have to endure on its way to the goal, or determine that it cannot reach point x.",
  "input_format": "The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).\n\nFor each test case:\n- The first line contains 2 integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the number of types of jumps the frog can make and its final target.\n- The next n lines describe the jump types; the i-th line contains 3 integers a[i], b[i], and c[i] (1 ≤ a[i], b[i], c[i] ≤ 10^6).\n\nThe sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.",
  "output_format": "For each test case, if the frog can reach point x, output the smallest number of rollbacks it must endure. If it cannot reach point x, output -1.",
  "constraints": "Examples from test cases:\n- In the first test case, the frog can jump forward by 1 unit and reach point 1. Answer is 0.\n- In the third test case, the frog cannot reach point 4.\n- In the fourth test case, the frog can reach point 8, for example: jump using type 1 by 12, type 4 by 1, and type 2 by 10. Sequence: 0 → (rollback) -11 → 1 → 2 → (rollback) -2 → 8.\n- In the sixth test case, the frog reaches point 10 by jumping 6 times by 2 and 1 time by 1. Sequence: 0 → 2 → (rollback) 1 → 3 → 5 → (rollback) 4 → 6 → 8 → (rollback) 7 → 9 → 10.",
