  "description": "A permutation of length 𝑛 \n is an array consisting of 𝑛 \n distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] [1, 2, 2] and [1,3,4] [1, 3, 4] are not permutations. \nYou are given a permutation 𝑝 of length 𝑛. You can perform the following operation exactly once:\n Choose two integers 𝑙, 𝑙, 𝑟 (1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛). Reverse the segment [𝑙,𝑟] [𝑙, 𝑟] in the permutation 𝑝.\nYour task is to output the lexicographically maximum permutation that can be obtained by performing this operation. A permutation 𝑎 \n is lexicographically greater than a permutation 𝑏 \n if for the first position 𝑖 \n where they differ, it holds that 𝑎 𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑖 𝑎 𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑖\n.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the number 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2⋅ 10 5 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5). \nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 distinct integers 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2,..., 𝑝 𝑛 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2,.., 𝑝 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛) (1 ≤ 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛). \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of 𝑛 \n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5.",
