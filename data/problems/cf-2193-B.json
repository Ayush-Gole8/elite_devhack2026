  "description": "A permutation of length 𝑛 is an array consisting of 𝑛 distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]\n[\n2,3,1,5,4\n]\n is a permutation, but [1,2,2]\n[\n1,2,2\n]\n and [1,3,4]\n[\n1,3,4\n]\n are not permutations.\n\nYou are given a permutation 𝑝 of length 𝑛. You can perform the following operation exactly once:\n\nChoose two integers 𝑙,𝑙,\n 𝑟 (1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛).\nReverse the segment [𝑙,𝑟]\n[\n𝑙,𝑟\n]\n in the permutation 𝑝.\nYour task is to output the lexicographically maximum permutation that can be obtained by performing this operation. A permutation 𝑎 is lexicographically greater than a permutation 𝑏 if for the first position 𝑖 where they differ, it holds that 𝑎𝑖\n>\n𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑖\n>\n𝑏𝑖.",
  "input_format": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the number 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 distinct integers 𝑝1,𝑝2,...,𝑝𝑛𝑝1,𝑝2,\n.\n.\n,𝑝𝑛 (1≤𝑝𝑖≤𝑛)\n.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of 𝑛 across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.",
  "output_format": "For each test case, output the lexicographically maximum permutation that can be obtained with one operation.",
  "constraints": "For the first test case, the best segment is [1,4]\n[\n1,4\n]\n. After reversing, 𝑎=[4,1,2,3]\n𝑎=\n[\n4,1,2,3\n]\n. For the second test case, the best segment is [2,3]\n[\n2,3\n]\n. After reversing, 𝑎=[3,2,1]\n𝑎=\n[\n3,2,1\n]\n.",
