  "description": "Alice and Bob have two integers 𝑝 and 𝑞, and they are playing a game with these numbers. The players take turns, with Alice going first. On their turn, a player can do one of two actions:\n\ndecrease 𝑝 by one (this action is possible if 𝑝>0 𝑝\n>\n0);\ndecrease 𝑞 by one (this action is possible if 𝑞>1 𝑞\n>\n1).\n\nThe game ends when 𝑝=0 and 𝑞=1.\n\nBob wins if at any point during the game the fraction 𝑝𝑞 is equal to in value the fraction 2^3. Otherwise, Alice wins.\n\nGiven the initial values of 𝑝 and 𝑞, determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally.",
  "input_format": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach input case consists of a single line containing two integers 𝑝 and 𝑞 (1≤𝑝,𝑞≤10^18).",
  "output_format": "For each input case, output:\n\n\"Alice\" if Alice wins;\n\"Bob\" if Bob wins.",
  "constraints": "In the first input case, the fraction is already equal to 2^3 by value, so Bob wins.\n\nIn the second input case, one possible sequence of the game is as follows:\n\ninitially 𝑝=10,𝑞=14;\nafter Alice's turn 𝑝=9,𝑞=14;\nafter Bob's turn 𝑝=9,𝑞=13;\nafter Alice's turn 𝑝=9,𝑞=12;\nafter Bob's turn 𝑝=8,𝑞=12.\n\nBob wins, as 8^12 is equal to 2^3. It can be shown that in this example, with optimal play from both players, Bob always wins.\n\nFor the third input case, Alice's optimal strategy will be to decrease 𝑞 as long as possible. In this case, the game will end in favor of Alice regardless of Bob's actions.",
