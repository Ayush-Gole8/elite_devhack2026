  "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, 2 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛-1 2 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 - 1\n. Note that a correct solution for the hard version is not necessarily a correct solution for the easy version.\n\nGiven a natural number 𝑛. Find a permutation ∗ 𝑝 of length 𝑛, such that for each 𝑖 (2 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛-1 2 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 - 1) there exists a 𝑗 (𝑖 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 𝑖 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛) such that 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑗 ⊕𝑖 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑗 ⊕ 𝑖 †. \nIt can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, there exists at least one suitable permutation 𝑝. ∗ \nA permutation of length 𝑛 \n is an array consisting of 𝑛 \n distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 \n appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] [1, 3, 4]\n is also not a permutation (𝑛=3 𝑛 = 3 but there is 4 in the array). † ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (3 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2⋅ 10 5 3 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5\n) — the length of the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 \n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5.",
  "output_format": "Output\n\nFor each test case, output 𝑛 integers 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2,…, 𝑝 𝑛 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, …, 𝑝 𝑛  — the permutation 𝑝. \nIf there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.",
  "constraints": "Note\n\nIn the first test case, the permutation 𝑝=[2,1,3] 𝑝 = [2, 1, 3] is suitable since 𝑝 2 =1 𝑝 2 = 1 and 𝑝 3 ⊕2=1 𝑝 3 ⊕ 2 = 1. \nIn the second test case, the permutation 𝑝=[3,6,2,5,1,4] 𝑝 = [3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4] is suitable, as: 𝑝 2 =6=4⊕2= 𝑝 6 ⊕2 𝑝 2 = 6 = 4 ⊕ 2 = 𝑝 6 ⊕ 2 𝑝 3 =2=1⊕3= 𝑝 5 ⊕3 𝑝 3 = 2 = 1 ⊕ 3 = 𝑝 5 ⊕ 3 𝑝 4 =5=1⊕4= 𝑝 5 ⊕4 𝑝 4 = 5 = 1 ⊕ 4 = 𝑝 5 ⊕ 4 𝑝 5 =1=4⊕5= 𝑝 6 ⊕5 𝑝 5 = 1 = 4 ⊕ 5 = 𝑝 6 ⊕ 5",
