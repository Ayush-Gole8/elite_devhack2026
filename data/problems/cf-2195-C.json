  "description": "Consider the following cube \n𝐷\n𝐷\n where numbers \n𝑥\n𝑥\n and \n7−𝑥\n7\n−\n𝑥\n lie on opposite sides:\n\nImage generated by Nano Banana Pro.\n\nA sequence \n𝑏\n𝑏\n of integers from \n1\n1\n to \n6\n6\n is called a dice roll sequence if it satisfies the following condition:\n\nAll pairs of adjacent elements lie on adjacent\n∗\n∗\n sides of the cube.\n\nFor example, \n[1,4,2]\n[\n1\n,\n4\n,\n2\n]\n is a dice roll sequence, while \n[3,4,6,3]\n[\n3\n,\n4\n,\n6\n,\n3\n]\n is not because \n3\n3\n and \n4\n4\n are not on adjacent sides of the dice. Additionally, \n[2,2,4]\n[\n2\n,\n2\n,\n4\n]\n is not a dice roll sequence because \n2\n2\n and \n2\n2\n are on the same (not adjacent) side of the dice.\n\nGiven a sequence \n𝑎\n𝑎\n of \n𝑛\n𝑛\n integers from \n1\n1\n to \n6\n6\n, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).\n\nSelect an index \n1≤𝑖≤𝑛\n1\n≤\n𝑖\n≤\n𝑛\n and an integer \n1≤𝑥≤6\n1\n≤\n𝑥\n≤\n6\n. Then, change the value of \n𝑎\n𝑖\n𝑎\n𝑖\n to \n𝑥\n𝑥\n.\n\nPlease determine the minimum number of operations required to make \n𝑎\n𝑎\n a dice roll sequence.\n\n∗\n∗\nTwo sides of the cube \n𝑆\n𝑆\n and \n𝑇\n𝑇\n are called adjacent if they share exactly one edge of the cube. Do note that this condition implies \n𝑆≠𝑇\n𝑆\n≠\n𝑇\n as well.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n𝑡\n𝑡\n (\n1≤𝑡≤\n10\n4\n1\n≤\n𝑡\n≤\n10\n4\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \n𝑛\n𝑛\n (\n1≤𝑛≤3⋅\n10\n5\n1\n≤\n𝑛\n≤\n3\n⋅\n10\n5\n).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \n𝑛\n𝑛\n integers \n𝑎\n1\n,\n𝑎\n2\n,…,\n𝑎\n𝑛\n𝑎\n1\n,\n𝑎\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝑎\n𝑛\n (\n1≤\n𝑎\n𝑖\n≤6\n1\n≤\n𝑎\n𝑖\n≤\n6\n).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n𝑛\n𝑛\n over all test cases does not exceed \n3⋅\n10\n5\n3\n⋅\n10\n5\n.",
