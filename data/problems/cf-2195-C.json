  "description": "Consider the following cube 𝐷 where numbers 𝑥 and 7-𝑥 7 - 𝑥 lie on opposite sides: \nImage generated by Nano Banana Pro.\n A sequence 𝑏 of integers from 1 to 6 is called a dice roll sequence if it satisfies the following condition:\n\nAll pairs of adjacent elements lie on adjacent ∗ sides of the cube. For example, [1,4,2] [1, 4, 2] is a dice roll sequence, while [3,4,6,3] [3, 4, 6, 3] is not because 3 and 4 \n are not on adjacent sides of the dice. Additionally, [2,2,4] [2, 2, 4]\n is not a dice roll sequence because 2 and 2 are on the same (not adjacent) side of the dice.\n Given a sequence 𝑎 of 𝑛 integers from 1 to 6 \n, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).\n Select an index 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 and an integer 1 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 6 1 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 6\n. Then, change the value of 𝑎 𝑖 𝑎 𝑖 to 𝑥.\n\nPlease determine the minimum number of operations required to make 𝑎 a dice roll sequence. ∗ \nTwo sides of the cube 𝑆 and 𝑇 are called adjacent if they share exactly one edge of the cube. Do note that this condition implies 𝑆≠𝑇 𝑆 ≠ 𝑇\n as well.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 3⋅ 10 5 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 3 ⋅ 10 5). \nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2,…, 𝑎 𝑛 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2, …, 𝑎 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 6 1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 6). \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 \n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅ 10 5 3 ⋅ 10 5.",

  "constraints": "Note\n\nFor the first test case, the sequence 𝑎 is [1,4,2] [1, 4, 2]. As this is already a dice roll sequence, the answer is 0. \nFor the second test case, the sequence 𝑎 is [3,4,6,3] [3, 4, 6, 3].\n\nChanging exactly one element, you can get [3,5,6,3] [3, 5, 6, 3]\n, which is a dice roll sequence.\n\nFor the third test case, the sequence 𝑎 is [6,1,4,3,1,3,2,5,4,4] [6, 1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 4].\n Changing exactly 4 elements, you can get [5,1,4,2,1,3,2,1,5,4] [5, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4]\n, which is a dice roll sequence.",
