  "description": "Given a table of size 𝑛×𝑚, where each cell contains either 0 or 1. The task is to divide it into two parts with a cut that goes from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. The cut lines can only go right or down.\n\nLet 𝑎 be the number of ones in one part of the table after the cut, and 𝑏 be the number of ones in the other part of the table. The goal is to maximize the value of 𝑎⋅𝑏.",
  "input_format": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 (1≤𝑛,𝑚≤3⋅10^5, 2≤𝑛⋅𝑚≤3⋅10^5) — the number of rows and columns in the table, respectively.\n\nEach of the following 𝑛 lines contains 𝑚 integers, where the 𝑗-th number in the 𝑖-th line corresponds to the value 𝑎𝑖,𝑗 (0≤𝑎𝑖,𝑗≤1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛⋅𝑚 across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.",
  "output_format": "For each test case, output a single number in the first line of the output data — the maximum value of the product.\n\nIn the second line, output a string consisting of 𝑛\n characters  'D' and 𝑚\n characters  'R', representing the direction of the next cut, where 'D' means a cut downwards, and 'R' — a cut to the right.",
  "constraints": "The images show the correct cuts for each of the first and second test cases, at which the maximum value of the product is achieved.",
