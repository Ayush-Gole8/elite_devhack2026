  "description": "You are given a permutation 𝑎 of length 𝑛\n∗\n∗\n.\n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\nSelect an index 𝑖 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛2), and swap 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑎2𝑖𝑎2 𝑖.\n\nFor example, when 𝑎=[1,4,2,3,5]\n𝑎=\n[\n1,4,2,3,5\n]\n, you can swap 𝑎2 and 𝑎4 to make it [1,3,2,4,5]\n[\n1,3,2,4,5\n]\n, but you cannot swap 𝑎2 and 𝑎3.\n\nPlease determine if the sequence 𝑎 can be sorted in increasing order.\n\n∗\n∗\nA permutation of length 𝑛 is an array consisting of 𝑛 distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]\n[\n2,3,1,5,4\n]\n is a permutation, but [1,2,2]\n[\n1,2,2\n]\n is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]\n[\n1,3,4\n]\n is also not a permutation (𝑛=3 but there is 4 in the array).",
  "input_format": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 distinct integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤𝑛).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.",
  "output_format": "If 𝑎 can be sorted in increasing order, output \"YES\" on a separate line. Otherwise, output \"NO\" on a separate line.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will also be recognized as positive responses.",
  "constraints": "In the first test case, 𝑎 is [1,4,3,2,5]\n[\n1,4,3,2,5\n]\n. You can sort 𝑎 in increasing order by swapping 𝑎2 and 𝑎4. Therefore, the answer is \"YES\".\n\nIn the second test case, 𝑎 is [1,4,2,3,5]\n[\n1,4,2,3,5\n]\n. It is impossible to sort 𝑎 in increasing order. Therefore, the answer is \"NO\".",
