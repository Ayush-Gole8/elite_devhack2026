  "description": "You are given a permutation 𝑎 of length 𝑛 ∗.\n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n Select an index 𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 2 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 2), and swap 𝑎 𝑖 𝑎 𝑖 and 𝑎 2𝑖 𝑎 2 𝑖. For example, when 𝑎=[1,4,2,3,5] 𝑎 = [1, 4, 2, 3, 5], you can swap 𝑎 2 𝑎 2 and 𝑎 4 𝑎 4 to make it [1,3,2,4,5] [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], but you cannot swap 𝑎 2 𝑎 2 and 𝑎 3 𝑎 3. \nPlease determine if the sequence 𝑎 \n can be sorted in increasing order. ∗ A permutation of length 𝑛 \n is an array consisting of 𝑛 \n distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 \n appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] [1, 3, 4]\n is also not a permutation (𝑛=3 𝑛 = 3 but there is 4 in the array).",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2⋅ 10 5 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5). \nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 distinct integers 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2,…, 𝑎 𝑛 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2, …, 𝑎 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛). \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 \n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5.",
  "output_format": "Output\n If 𝑎 can be sorted in increasing order, output \"YES\" on a separate line. Otherwise, output \"NO\" on a separate line.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will also be recognized as positive responses.",
  "constraints": "Note\n\nIn the first test case, 𝑎 is [1,4,3,2,5] [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]. You can sort 𝑎 \n in increasing order by swapping 𝑎 2 𝑎 2 and 𝑎 4 𝑎 4. Therefore, the answer is \"YES\".\n\nIn the second test case, 𝑎 is [1,4,2,3,5] [1, 4, 2, 3, 5]. It is impossible to sort 𝑎 \n in increasing order. Therefore, the answer is \"NO\".",
