  "description": "You are given a permutation \n𝑎\n𝑎\n of length \n𝑛\n𝑛\n∗\n∗\n.\n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\nSelect an index \n𝑖\n𝑖\n (\n1≤𝑖≤\n𝑛\n2\n1\n≤\n𝑖\n≤\n𝑛\n2\n), and swap \n𝑎\n𝑖\n𝑎\n𝑖\n and \n𝑎\n2𝑖\n𝑎\n2\n𝑖\n.\n\nFor example, when \n𝑎=[1,4,2,3,5]\n𝑎\n=\n[\n1\n,\n4\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n5\n]\n, you can swap \n𝑎\n2\n𝑎\n2\n and \n𝑎\n4\n𝑎\n4\n to make it \n[1,3,2,4,5]\n[\n1\n,\n3\n,\n2\n,\n4\n,\n5\n]\n, but you cannot swap \n𝑎\n2\n𝑎\n2\n and \n𝑎\n3\n𝑎\n3\n.\n\nPlease determine if the sequence \n𝑎\n𝑎\n can be sorted in increasing order.\n\n∗\n∗\nA permutation of length \n𝑛\n𝑛\n is an array consisting of \n𝑛\n𝑛\n distinct integers from \n1\n1\n to \n𝑛\n𝑛\n in arbitrary order. For example, \n[2,3,1,5,4]\n[\n2\n,\n3\n,\n1\n,\n5\n,\n4\n]\n is a permutation, but \n[1,2,2]\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n2\n]\n is not a permutation (\n2\n2\n appears twice in the array), and \n[1,3,4]\n[\n1\n,\n3\n,\n4\n]\n is also not a permutation (\n𝑛=3\n𝑛\n=\n3\n but there is \n4\n4\n in the array).",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n𝑡\n𝑡\n (\n1≤𝑡≤\n10\n4\n1\n≤\n𝑡\n≤\n10\n4\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \n𝑛\n𝑛\n (\n1≤𝑛≤2⋅\n10\n5\n1\n≤\n𝑛\n≤\n2\n⋅\n10\n5\n).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains \n𝑛\n𝑛\n distinct integers \n𝑎\n1\n,\n𝑎\n2\n,…,\n𝑎\n𝑛\n𝑎\n1\n,\n𝑎\n2\n,\n…\n,\n𝑎\n𝑛\n (\n1≤\n𝑎\n𝑖\n≤𝑛\n1\n≤\n𝑎\n𝑖\n≤\n𝑛\n).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n𝑛\n𝑛\n over all test cases does not exceed \n2⋅\n10\n5\n2\n⋅\n10\n5\n.",
  "output_format": "Output\n\nIf \n𝑎\n𝑎\n can be sorted in increasing order, output \"YES\" on a separate line. Otherwise, output \"NO\" on a separate line.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will also be recognized as positive responses.",
  "constraints": "Note\n\nIn the first test case, \n𝑎\n𝑎\n is \n[1,4,3,2,5]\n[\n1\n,\n4\n,\n3\n,\n2\n,\n5\n]\n. You can sort \n𝑎\n𝑎\n in increasing order by swapping \n𝑎\n2\n𝑎\n2\n and \n𝑎\n4\n𝑎\n4\n. Therefore, the answer is \"YES\".\n\nIn the second test case, \n𝑎\n𝑎\n is \n[1,4,2,3,5]\n[\n1\n,\n4\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n5\n]\n. It is impossible to sort \n𝑎\n𝑎\n in increasing order. Therefore, the answer is \"NO\".",
