  "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n For a permutation ∗ 𝑔=(𝑔 1, 𝑔 2,…, 𝑔 𝑚) 𝑔 = (𝑔 1, 𝑔 2, …, 𝑔 𝑚), define its reverse as rev(𝑔)=(𝑔 𝑚, 𝑔 𝑚-1,…, 𝑔 1) rev ⁡ (𝑔) = (𝑔 𝑚, 𝑔 𝑚 - 1, …, 𝑔 1).\n\nThere is a hidden permutation 𝑝 of size 𝑛. Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest † permutation 𝑞 of size 𝑛 such that 𝑞>𝑝 𝑞 > 𝑝 and rev(𝑞)>rev(𝑝) rev ⁡ (𝑞) > rev ⁡ (𝑝). \nHowever, you do not need to output 𝑞 \n itself. Instead, you must output a permutation 𝑟 of size 𝑛 such that 𝑞 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑟 𝑖 𝑞 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑟 𝑖 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛. If no such 𝑞 \n exists, report that instead.\n\nTo find the answer, you can ask at most 3𝑛 3 𝑛 queries of the form ? 𝑖𝑗 ?  𝑖 𝑗 (1 ≤ 𝑖,𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛). The interactor responds with 1 if 𝑝 𝑖 < 𝑝 𝑗 𝑝 𝑖 < 𝑝 𝑗 and 0 \n otherwise. The interactor is not adaptive, which means that the permutation 𝑝 \n is fixed throughout the interaction. ∗ A permutation of length 𝑛 \n is an array consisting of 𝑛 \n distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 \n appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] [1, 3, 4]\n is also not a permutation (𝑛=3 𝑛 = 3 but there is 4 in the array). † An array 𝑥 \n is lexicographically smaller than array 𝑦 (so 𝑥<𝑦 𝑥 < 𝑦) if and only if one of the following holds: 𝑥 is a prefix of 𝑦, but 𝑥≠𝑦 𝑥 ≠ 𝑦 ; or Let 𝑖 be the first position where 𝑥 𝑖 ≠ 𝑦 𝑖 𝑥 𝑖 ≠ 𝑦 𝑖 (if it exists), then 𝑥 𝑖 < 𝑦 𝑖 𝑥 𝑖 < 𝑦 𝑖. Interaction \nFor each test case, first read a single integer 𝑛. You may ask up to 3𝑛 3 𝑛\n queries in each test case.\n\nTo ask a query, print a line in the format ?𝑖𝑗 ? 𝑖 𝑗 (1 ≤ 𝑖,𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛).\n\nAs a response to the query, you will get: 1 if 𝑝 𝑖 < 𝑝 𝑗 𝑝 𝑖 < 𝑝 𝑗 ; 0 if 𝑝 𝑖 ≥ 𝑝 𝑗 𝑝 𝑖 ≥ 𝑝 𝑗 ; -1 - 1\n if you made an invalid query or if you exceed the limit of 3𝑛 3 𝑛 queries.\n\nIf your program makes more than 3𝑛 3 𝑛 queries for one test case, or makes an invalid query, then the response to the query will be \"-1\". After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nWhen you determine the answer for the current test case, print one of the following:\n\nIf no valid permutation 𝑞 exists, print !-1 ! - 1. Otherwise, print ! 𝑟 1 𝑟 2 … 𝑟 𝑛 ! 𝑟 1 𝑟 2 … 𝑟 𝑛, where 𝑟 \n is a permutation of size 𝑛 and 𝑞 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑟 𝑖 𝑞 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑟 𝑖.\n\nNote that this output does not count towards the query limit of 3𝑛 3 𝑛.\n\nAfter that, proceed to the next test case or terminate your program if there are no more test cases.\n\nAfter printing each query do not forget to output the end of line and flush ∗ \n the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded verdict.\n\nIf, at any interaction step, you read -1 - 1 instead of valid data, your solution must exit immediately. This means that your solution will receive Wrong answer because of an invalid query or any other mistake. Failing to exit can result in an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nNote that the interactor is not adaptive, which means that the hidden permutation is unchanged throughout the interaction. Hacks To hack, use the following format.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 1000 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain a positive integer 𝑛 (2 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2⋅ 10 4 2 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 4) — the size of 𝑝.\n\nThe second line of each test case should contain 𝑛 integers 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2,…, 𝑝 𝑛 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, …, 𝑝 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛). \nYou have to guarantee that given 𝑝 \n is a permutation and that the sum of 𝑛 \n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10 4 2 ⋅ 10 4. ∗ To flush, use:\n\nfflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\nsys.stdout.flush() in Python;\nsee the documentation for other languages.",
