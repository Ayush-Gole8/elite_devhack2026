  "description": "Given a string \n𝑠\n𝑠\n of even length, consisting of the characters \"(\", \")\", \"[\" and \"]\", which are brackets of two types (round and square).\n\nWe call a string \n𝑡\n𝑡\n beautiful if it satisfies two conditions simultaneously:\n\nThe subsequence of all round brackets forms a correct bracket sequence\n∗\n∗\n;\nThe subsequence of all square brackets forms a correct bracket sequence.\n\nFor example, the string \"[(][)[]]()\" is beautiful, as the subsequence of all round brackets in it \"()()\" forms a correct bracket sequence and the subsequence of all square brackets in it \"[][[]]\" forms a correct bracket sequence.\n\nYou would like to turn \n𝑠\n𝑠\n into any beautiful string; for this, you can change the characters: in one operation, you can choose a position \n𝑖\n𝑖\n, such that \n1≤𝑖≤𝑛\n1\n≤\n𝑖\n≤\n𝑛\n and change the character \n𝑠\n𝑖\n𝑠\n𝑖\n to any round or square bracket.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations required to transform \n𝑠\n𝑠\n into any beautiful string?\n\n∗\n∗\nA bracket sequence is called correct if by inserting the symbols \"+\" and \"1\" into it, one can obtain a valid mathematical expression. For example, the sequences \"(())()\", \"[]\" and \"(()(()))\" are correct, while \")(\", \"[[]\" and \"(()))(\" are not.",

The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \n𝑛\n𝑛\n (\n2≤𝑛≤2⋅\n10\n5\n2\n≤\n𝑛\n≤\n2\n⋅\n10\n5\n) — the length of the string \n𝑠\n𝑠\n. It is guaranteed that \n𝑛\n𝑛\n is even.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string \n𝑠\n𝑠\n of length \n𝑛\n𝑛\n, consisting only of the characters \"(\", \")\", \"[\" and \"]\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n𝑛\n𝑛\n across all test cases does not exceed \n2⋅\n10\n5\n2\n⋅\n10\n5",
