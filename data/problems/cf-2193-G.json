  "description": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nIn this interactive problem, you are given an acyclic, connected, undirected graph consisting of 𝑛 \n vertices. We define a path between two vertices 𝑣 and 𝑢 as a sequence of distinct vertices 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2,… 𝑝 𝑘 𝑝 1, 𝑝 2, … 𝑝 𝑘 such that 𝑝 1 =𝑣 𝑝 1 = 𝑣, 𝑝 𝑘 =𝑢 𝑝 𝑘 = 𝑢, and for all 𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖<𝑘 1 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑘), there exists an edge between vertices 𝑝 𝑖 𝑝 𝑖 and 𝑝 𝑖+1 𝑝 𝑖 + 1.\n\nThere are hidden vertices 𝑥 and 𝑦 (they may coincide). You can make the following queries:\n Choose two vertices 𝑎, 𝑏 (1 ≤ 𝑎,𝑏 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑎, 𝑏 ≤ 𝑛). The jury will respond with 1 \n if the path between vertices 𝑥, 𝑦 and the path between vertices 𝑎, 𝑏 share at least one common vertex, and will respond with 0 otherwise. Your task is to find at least one vertex on the path between 𝑥 and 𝑦 in no more than ⌊ 𝑛 2 ⌋+1 ⌊ 𝑛 2 ⌋ + 1 queries. \nNote that the interactor is adaptive, which means that the hidden vertices may change depending on your queries, but will not contradict previous queries. Interaction \nTo find any vertex on the path, you can use no more than ⌊ 𝑛 2 ⌋+1 ⌊ 𝑛 2 ⌋ + 1\n queries. For this, use queries of the form \"? 𝑎 𝑏 \".\n\nAfter each query, read one number, either 0 or 1 — the response to the query.\n\nWhen you find one of the required vertices, output one line in the following format: \"! 𝑣 \" (1 ≤ 𝑣 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑣 ≤ 𝑛), where 𝑣 is the vertex you found. \nIf your program makes more than ⌊ 𝑛 2 ⌋+1 ⌊ 𝑛 2 ⌋ + 1\n queries for one test case, the response to the query will be -1 - 1, and after receiving such a response, your program should terminate immediately to receive a verdict of Incorrect answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.\n\nAfter outputting a query, do not forget to output a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive a verdict of Solution \"timed out\". To flush the buffer, use:\n\n𝚏𝚏𝚕𝚞𝚜𝚑(𝚜𝚝𝚍𝚘𝚞𝚝) 𝑓 𝑙 𝑢 𝑠 ℎ (𝑠 𝑡 𝑑 𝑜 𝑢 𝑡) or 𝚌𝚘𝚞𝚝.𝚏𝚕𝚞𝚜𝚑() 𝑐 𝑜 𝑢 𝑡. 𝑓 𝑙 𝑢 𝑠 ℎ () in C++; 𝚂𝚢𝚜𝚝𝚎𝚖.𝚘𝚞𝚝.𝚏𝚕𝚞𝚜𝚑() 𝑆 𝑦 𝑠 𝑡 𝑒 𝑚. 𝑜 𝑢 𝑡. 𝑓 𝑙 𝑢 𝑠 ℎ () in Java; 𝚏𝚕𝚞𝚜𝚑(𝚘𝚞𝚝𝚙𝚞𝚝) 𝑓 𝑙 𝑢 𝑠 ℎ (𝑜 𝑢 𝑡 𝑝 𝑢 𝑡) in Pascal; 𝚜𝚝𝚍𝚘𝚞𝚝.𝚏𝚕𝚞𝚜𝚑() 𝑠 𝑡 𝑑 𝑜 𝑢 𝑡. 𝑓 𝑙 𝑢 𝑠 ℎ () in Python;\nrefer to the documentation for other languages.",
