  "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, 𝑘 ≤ 10 𝑘 ≤ 10\n. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nGiven a tree consisting of 𝑛 \n vertices. Each vertex has a non-negative integer 𝑎 𝑣 𝑎 𝑣\n written on it. You are also given 𝑘 \n distinct non-negative integers 𝑏 1,…, 𝑏 𝑘 𝑏 1, …, 𝑏 𝑘. \nWe will call a set of edges beautiful if, after removing these edges from the tree, the tree splits into connected components, where in each component the bitwise XOR of all the numbers 𝑎 𝑣 𝑎 𝑣\n in that component belongs to the set 𝑏. \nYou need to count the number of beautiful sets of edges in the tree modulo 10 9 +7 10 9 + 7.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 500 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 500). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each dataset contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑘 (2 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10 5 2 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10 5, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 10 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 10\n) — the number of vertices in the tree and the size of the set 𝑏. The next 𝑛-1 𝑛 - 1 lines describe the edges of the tree. The 𝑖 \n-th line contains two integers 𝑣 𝑖 𝑣 𝑖 and 𝑢 𝑖 𝑢 𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑣 𝑖, 𝑢 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑣 𝑖, 𝑢 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛\n) — the numbers of the vertices connected by the 𝑖 -th edge. \nThe next line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2,…, 𝑎 𝑛 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2, …, 𝑎 𝑛 (0 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 < 2 30 0 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 < 2 30) — the values written on the vertices.\n\nThe following line contains 𝑘 distinct integers 𝑏 1, 𝑏 2,…, 𝑏 𝑘 𝑏 1, 𝑏 2, …, 𝑏 𝑘 (0 ≤ 𝑏 𝑖 < 2 30 0 ≤ 𝑏 𝑖 < 2 30) — the elements of the set 𝑏. \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 \n across all datasets does not exceed 10 5 10 5\n.",

  "constraints": "Note\n\nIllustration for the first test dataset. In it, you can remove the edge between vertices 1 and 2. Then the bitwise XOR in the component consisting of vertices 2 and 5 is 𝑎 2 ⊕ 𝑎 5 =2⊕3=1 𝑎 2 ⊕ 𝑎 5 = 2 ⊕ 3 = 1. The bitwise XOR in the component with vertices 1, 3, and 4 is 𝑎 1 ⊕ 𝑎 3 ⊕ 𝑎 4 =0⊕2⊕3=1 𝑎 1 ⊕ 𝑎 3 ⊕ 𝑎 4 = 0 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 3 = 1\n. The second beautiful set is the one consisting of the edge connecting vertices 1 and 3.\n\nIn the third test dataset, the beautiful sets will be (an edge is denoted by the pair of vertices it connects) \n[(1,2)],[(1,3)],[(2,5)],[(3,4)] [(1, 2)], [(1, 3)], [(2, 5)], [(3, 4)]. Note that the first and third samples differ only in the set 𝑏. \nIn the fourth test dataset, the beautiful sets will be \n[(1,2)],[(3,4)],[(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)] [(1, 2)], [(3, 4)], [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)].",
