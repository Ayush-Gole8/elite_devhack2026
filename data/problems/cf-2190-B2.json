  "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to find the sum of scores over all subsequences of 𝑠 ; 𝑠 is not necessarily a regular bracket sequence, and the constraints on 𝑛 are lower. \nWe say that a bracket sequence 𝑎 \n is better than a bracket sequence 𝑏 \n if one of the following holds: 𝑏 is a prefix of 𝑎, but 𝑎≠𝑏 𝑎 ≠ 𝑏 ; or let 𝑖 be the first position (if it exists) where 𝑎 𝑖 ≠ 𝑏 𝑖 𝑎 𝑖 ≠ 𝑏 𝑖, then 𝑎 𝑖 =(𝑎 𝑖 = (and 𝑏 𝑖 =) 𝑏 𝑖 =). \nFor an arbitrary bracket sequence 𝑡 \n, we define its score in the following way:\n If 𝑡 is not a regular bracket sequence ∗, the score is 0.\nIf there exists a regular bracket subsequence † 𝑟 of 𝑡 such that 𝑟 is better than 𝑡 \n, then the score is equal to the maximum value of |𝑟| | 𝑟 |\n over all such subsequences 𝑟. Otherwise, the score is 0. \nIn other words, the score of 𝑡 \n is the length of the longest regular bracket subsequence of 𝑡 \n which is better than 𝑡. If 𝑡 is not a regular bracket sequence, or if no regular subsequence better than 𝑡 exists, the score is 0.\n\nYou are given a bracket sequence 𝑠 of length 𝑛. Find the sum of the scores of all non-empty subsequences of 𝑠 modulo 998244353 998 244 353. ∗ A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting the characters 𝟷 1 and + between the original characters of the sequence. For example:\n bracket sequences ()() and (()) \n are regular (the resulting expressions are (𝟷)+(𝟷) (1)+(1) and ((𝟷+𝟷)+𝟷) ((1+1)+1)); bracket sequences)(, (, and) are not. † A sequence 𝑎 \n is a subsequence of a sequence 𝑏 if 𝑎 can be obtained from 𝑏 \n by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 30 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 30). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100) — the length of the string 𝑠. \nThe second line of each test case contains a sequence 𝑠 of length 𝑛 consisting only of characters (and).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 \n over all test cases does not exceed 100 \n.",

  "constraints": "Note\n\nIn the first example, the only non-empty subsequence is 𝑔=(𝑔 = (\n. It is not a regular bracket sequence, so its score is 0 \n, and the total sum is also 0. \nIn the second example, consider 𝑔=𝑠=()()() 𝑔 = 𝑠 = ()()()\n. It is a regular bracket sequence. We can choose 𝑟=(()) 𝑟 = (())\n, which is a subsequence of 𝑔 \n. The first index where 𝑟 and 𝑔 differ is 𝑖=2 𝑖 = 2. Since 𝑟 2 =(𝑟 2 = (and 𝑔 2 =) 𝑔 2 =), 𝑟 is better than 𝑔 \n. Hence, the score of 𝑔 is |𝑟|=4 | 𝑟 | = 4. All the other non-empty subsequences of 𝑠 have scores equal to 0.",
