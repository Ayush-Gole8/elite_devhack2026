  "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to find the sum of scores over all subsequences of 𝑠; 𝑠 is not necessarily a regular bracket sequence, and the constraints on 𝑛 are lower.\n\nWe say that a bracket sequence 𝑎 is better than a bracket sequence 𝑏 if one of the following holds:\n\n𝑏 is a prefix of 𝑎, but 𝑎≠𝑏𝑎≠𝑏; or\nlet 𝑖 be the first position (if it exists) where 𝑎𝑖≠𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑖≠𝑏𝑖, then 𝑎𝑖=(𝑎𝑖=\n(\n and 𝑏𝑖=)𝑏𝑖=\n)\n.\n\nFor an arbitrary bracket sequence 𝑡, we define its score in the following way:\n\nIf 𝑡 is not a regular bracket sequence\n∗\n∗\n, the score is 0.\nIf there exists a regular bracket subsequence †\n†\n 𝑟 of 𝑡 such that 𝑟 is better than 𝑡, then the score is equal to the maximum value of |𝑟|\n over all such subsequences 𝑟.\nOtherwise, the score is 0.\n\nIn other words, the score of 𝑡 is the length of the longest regular bracket subsequence of 𝑡 which is better than 𝑡. If 𝑡 is not a regular bracket sequence, or if no regular subsequence better than 𝑡 exists, the score is 0.\n\nYou are given a bracket sequence 𝑠 of length 𝑛. Find the sum of the scores of all non-empty subsequences of 𝑠 modulo 998244353.\n\n∗\n∗\nA regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting the characters 𝟷1 and +\n between the original characters of the sequence. For example:\n\nbracket sequences ()()\n and (())\n are regular (the resulting expressions are (𝟷)+(𝟷)(1)+(1)\n and ((𝟷+𝟷)((1+1);\nbracket sequences )(\n, (\n, and )\n are not.\n\n†\n†\nA sequence 𝑎 is a subsequence of a sequence 𝑏 if 𝑎 can be obtained from 𝑏 by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.",
  "input_format": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤30). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤100) — the length of the string 𝑠.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a sequence 𝑠 of length 𝑛 consisting only of characters (\n and )\n.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 100.",
  "output_format": "For each test case, print a single integer — the sum of the scores of all subsequences of 𝑠, modulo 998244353.",
  "constraints": "In the first example, the only non-empty subsequence is 𝑔=(𝑔=\n(\n. It is not a regular bracket sequence, so its score is 0, and the total sum is also 0.\n\nIn the second example, consider 𝑔=𝑠=()()()𝑔=𝑠=\n()()()\n. It is a regular bracket sequence. We can choose 𝑟=(())𝑟=\n(())\n, which is a subsequence of 𝑔. The first index where 𝑟 and 𝑔 differ is 𝑖=2. Since 𝑟2=(𝑟2=\n(\n and 𝑔2=)𝑔2=\n)\n, 𝑟 is better than 𝑔. Hence, the score of 𝑔 is |𝑟|=4|𝑟|\n=4. All the other non-empty subsequences of 𝑠 have scores equal to 0.",
