  "description": "DBMB had a birthday yesterday. He was gifted an array a of n elements and a number x. But there is one problem: he only likes arrays where the sum of the elements equals s. To make the array appealing to him, you can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\nChoose an index i (1≤i≤n) and add x to the number ai.\n\nFor example, if he was given the array [1,2,3,5] and x=2, you can choose index 3 and get the array [1,2,5,5]. Your task is to determine whether the array can appeal to DBMB after any number of operations.",
  "input_format": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n, s, x (1≤n,x≤10, 1≤s≤100).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10) — the elements of the array gifted to DBMB.",
  "output_format": "For each test case, output \"YES\" if the array can appeal to DBMB. Otherwise, output \"NO\". You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase).",
