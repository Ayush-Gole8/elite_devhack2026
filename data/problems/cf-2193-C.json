  "description": "Today, KQ has an exam at the Grail Academy. A strict teacher gave a task that KQ could not solve. He was given two arrays 𝑎 and 𝑏 of length 𝑛 \n. KQ is allowed to perform the following operations on the arrays:\n Choose an index 𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖<𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛) and replace 𝑎 𝑖 𝑎 𝑖 with 𝑎 𝑖+1 𝑎 𝑖 + 1. Choose an index 𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛) and replace 𝑎 𝑖 𝑎 𝑖 with 𝑏 𝑖 𝑏 𝑖. Now he has 𝑞 queries. Each query is described by two numbers 𝑙 and 𝑟. His task is to find the maximum value of the sum (𝑎 𝑙 + 𝑎 𝑙+1 + 𝑎 𝑙+2 +⋯+ 𝑎 𝑟) (𝑎 𝑙 + 𝑎 𝑙 + 1 + 𝑎 𝑙 + 2 + ⋯ + 𝑎 𝑟)\n for each query, if he can perform any number of operations on any elements of the array. Since he is not skilled enough for this, he asks for your help.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛, 𝑞 (1 ≤ 𝑛,𝑞 ≤ 2⋅ 10 5) (1 ≤ 𝑛, 𝑞 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5). \nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2,..., 𝑎 𝑛 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2,.., 𝑎 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 10 4) (1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 10 4). \nThe third line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑏 1, 𝑏 2,..., 𝑏 𝑛 𝑏 1, 𝑏 2,.., 𝑏 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑏 𝑖 ≤ 10 4) (1 ≤ 𝑏 𝑖 ≤ 10 4). The following 𝑞 lines contain two integers 𝑙 and 𝑟 (1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛) (1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛). \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of 𝑛 \n and the sum of the values of 𝑞 \n across all test cases do not exceed 2⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5.",
