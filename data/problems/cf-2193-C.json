  "description": "Today, KQ has an exam at the Grail Academy. A strict teacher gave a task that KQ could not solve. He was given two arrays 𝑎 and 𝑏 of length 𝑛. KQ is allowed to perform the following operations on the arrays:\n\nChoose an index 𝑖 (1≤𝑖<𝑛1≤𝑖\n<\n𝑛) and replace 𝑎𝑖 with 𝑎𝑖+1.\nChoose an index 𝑖 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛) and replace 𝑎𝑖 with 𝑏𝑖.\nNow he has 𝑞 queries. Each query is described by two numbers 𝑙 and 𝑟. His task is to find the maximum value of the sum (𝑎𝑙+1+𝑎𝑙+2+⋯+𝑎𝑟)(𝑎𝑙+1+𝑎𝑙+2+\n⋯\n+𝑎𝑟)\n for each query, if he can perform any number of operations on any elements of the array. Since he is not skilled enough for this, he asks for your help.",
  "input_format": "Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛, 𝑞 (1≤𝑛,𝑞≤2⋅10^5)\n.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,...,𝑎𝑛𝑎1,𝑎2,\n.\n.\n,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤10^4)\n.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,...,𝑏𝑛𝑏1,𝑏2,\n.\n.\n,𝑏𝑛 (1≤𝑏𝑖≤10^4)\n.\n\nThe following 𝑞 lines contain two integers 𝑙 and 𝑟 (1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛)\n.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of 𝑛 and the sum of the values of 𝑞 across all test cases do not exceed 2⋅10^5.",
  "output_format": "For each test case, output 𝑞 numbers separated by spaces — the maximum values of the sums (𝑎𝑙+1+𝑎𝑙+2+⋯+𝑎𝑟)(𝑎𝑙+1+𝑎𝑙+2+\n⋯\n+𝑎𝑟)\n.",
  "constraints": "Consider the first test case. Replace 𝑎3 with 𝑏3, 𝑎=[3,2,3]\n𝑎=\n[\n3,2,3\n]\n. Replace 𝑎2 with 𝑎3, 𝑎=[3,3,3]\n𝑎=\n[\n3,3,3\n]\n. The sum 𝑎1+𝑎2+𝑎3=9.",
