  "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, 𝑛 ≤ 10 5,𝑚 ≤ 10 4 𝑛 ≤ 10 5, 𝑚 ≤ 10 4. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.\n\nThere are two strings 𝑠 and 𝑡, both consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You also have an empty string 𝑝. \nYou can perform the following operation, which consists of several stages:\n\nchoose any two integers 𝑙 and 𝑟 (1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ |𝑠| 1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ | 𝑠 |); copy the substring 𝑠 𝑙,…, 𝑠 𝑟 𝑠 𝑙, …, 𝑠 𝑟\n and append it to the end of string 𝑝 ; among the last 𝑟-𝑙+1 𝑟 - 𝑙 + 1\n characters of string 𝑝 \n, change at most one character to any lowercase Latin letter.\n\nFor example, if the string 𝑠= 𝑠 = \"dhhtyhwbsl\" and 𝑝= 𝑝 = \"\", you can choose 𝑙=3,𝑟=6 𝑙 = 3, 𝑟 = 6\n and add \"htyh\" to the end of 𝑝 \n, and then change the character \"y\" to \"a\", resulting in 𝑝= 𝑝 = \"htah\".\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of operations required for string 𝑝 to become equal to 𝑡.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10 5 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10 5, 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 10 4) — the lengths of strings 𝑠 and 𝑡.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the string 𝑠 of length 𝑛, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains the string 𝑡 of length 𝑚, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 \n across all test cases does not exceed 10 5 10 5, and the sum of 𝑚 across all test cases does not exceed 10 4 10 4\n.",
  "output_format": "Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the answer to the problem.",
  "constraints": "Note\n\nIn the first test case, you can take the substring «𝚊» « 𝑎 » from the string 𝑠, change a single letter in this string to «𝚋» « 𝑏 »\n, and append it to the end of the string 𝑝, resulting in 𝑝 becoming equal to 𝑡. \nIn the second test case, 𝑡 can be obtained in 3 operations as follows:\n «𝚊𝚋»+«𝚣»+«𝚋𝚊» « 𝑎 𝑏 » + « 𝑧 » + « 𝑏 𝑎 »\n\nThe modified characters are highlighted in red.\n\nIn the third test case, the string 𝑡 \n can be obtained as follows:\n\n«𝚑𝚝𝚊𝚑»+«𝚋𝚜𝚎»+«𝚑𝚝𝚢𝚑𝚣𝚋» « ℎ 𝑡 𝑎 ℎ » + « 𝑏 𝑠 𝑒 » + « ℎ 𝑡 𝑦 ℎ 𝑧 𝑏\n»",
