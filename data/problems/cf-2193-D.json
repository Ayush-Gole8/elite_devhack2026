  "description": "You have been gifted a new game called \"Elatyh\". In the game, you are given 𝑛 \n swords, each with its own strength. In particular, the sword numbered 𝑖 has a strength of 𝑎 𝑖 𝑎 𝑖. The game consists of 𝑛 \n levels, each of which features a monster.\n You start at level 1 and progress further. To pass level 𝑖 and move on to level 𝑖+1 𝑖 + 1, you need to defeat the monster at level 𝑖 \n. To defeat the monster at level 𝑖, you need to deal it 𝑏 𝑖 𝑏 𝑖 sword strikes. The swords in the game are very fragile, so they can only deal one strike before breaking. If you complete level 𝑛 \n or run out of swords, you can finish the game and proceed to score calculation.\n\nBefore the game, you are allowed to choose the difficulty level. If you choose difficulty 𝑥 \n, swords with a strength less than 𝑥 \n will not affect the monsters. The game score in this case is equal to 𝑥 \n multiplied by the number of levels completed. Your task is to choose the game difficulty in such a way as to maximize the game score.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2⋅ 10 5 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5). \nThe second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2,…, 𝑎 𝑛 𝑎 1, 𝑎 2, …, 𝑎 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 10 9) (1 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 10 9). \nThe third line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑏 1, 𝑏 2,…, 𝑏 𝑛 𝑏 1, 𝑏 2, …, 𝑏 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑏 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛) (1 ≤ 𝑏 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛). \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of 𝑛 \n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5.",
  "output_format": "Output\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum game score.",
  "constraints": "Note\n\nConsider the first test case. Optimal difficulty to choose is 3. If difficulty is 3, you can deal strikes with swords number 2 and 3. With 2 \n swords you can complete 1 \n level, so the game score is 3⋅1=3 3 ⋅ 1 = 3\n.",
