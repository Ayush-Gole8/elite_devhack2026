  "description": "You are given a binary string ∗ 𝑠 of length 𝑛. \nIn one operation with a binary string 𝑔 of length 𝑘, you can do the following:\n choose some 𝑙,𝑟 𝑙, 𝑟 such that 1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑘 1 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑘 ; replace the substring † 𝑔 𝑙,…, 𝑔 𝑟 𝑔 𝑙, …, 𝑔 𝑟 of the string 𝑔 with one character that appears in this substring at least as many times as the other character.\n\nThe cost of such an operation will be equal to 𝑟-𝑙+1 𝑟 - 𝑙 + 1. \nFor example, the string 010010 can be transformed into 010 in one operation with a cost of 4 \n by replacing the substring 1001 with 1; the string 1111 can be transformed into 1 by performing an operation with a cost of 4 \n on the entire string, and the string 0100 can be transformed, for example, into 00 by taking the substring 100.\n\nYou need to find the minimum cost to transform the entire string 𝑠 \n into the string 1, using several (possibly none) operations, or determine that it is impossible. ∗ A binary string is a string that only consists of characters 0 and 1. † A string 𝑡 \n is a substring of a string 𝑔 if 𝑡 can be obtained from 𝑔 \n by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",
  "input_format": "Input\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 10 4\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 5⋅ 10 5 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 5 ⋅ 10 5\n) — the length of the binary string.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string of length 𝑛 \n, consisting of the characters 0 and 1 — the string 𝑠. \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 \n over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅ 10 5 ⋅ 10 5.",
  "output_format": "Output\n\nFor each test case, if it is impossible to obtain the string 1, output -1 - 1. Otherwise, output the minimum cost.",
  "constraints": "Note\n\nIn the first test case, it is impossible to obtain 1, since the only possible operation (𝑙=𝑟=1 𝑙 = 𝑟 = 1\n) does not change the string.\n\nIn the second test case, the string is already 1 initially, so the answer is 0.\n\nIn the fourth test case, it is possible to perform an operation on the entire string, replacing it with 1. The cost of this operation is 2 \n. It can be shown that it is impossible to obtain the string 1 for a lower cost.",
