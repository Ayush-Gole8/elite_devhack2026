  "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, it is guaranteed that the string 𝑠 does not contain the character ?.\n\nFor the string 𝑤1 𝑤2\n…\n𝑤𝑛𝑤1 𝑤2\n…\n𝑤𝑛, consisting of characters 0 and 1, we define 𝑓(𝑤)\n as the number of permutations 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛 of the array [0,1,…,𝑛−1]\n[\n0,1,…,𝑛−1\n]\n, such that for all 𝑖 from 1 to 𝑛 the following holds:\n\nif 𝑤𝑖=𝟷𝑤𝑖=1, then there exist such 1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛 that mex([\n𝑝𝑙,𝑝𝑙+1,…,𝑝𝑟\n])=𝑖\nmex\n⁡\n(\n[\n𝑝𝑙,𝑝𝑙+1,…,𝑝𝑟\n]\n)\n=𝑖;\n∗\n∗\n\nif 𝑤𝑖=𝟶𝑤𝑖=0, then there do not exist such 1≤𝑙≤𝑟≤𝑛 that mex([\n𝑝𝑙,𝑝𝑙+1,…,𝑝𝑟\n])=𝑖\nmex\n⁡\n(\n[\n𝑝𝑙,𝑝𝑙+1,…,𝑝𝑟\n]\n)\n=𝑖.\n\nGiven a string 𝑠1 𝑠2\n…\n𝑠𝑛𝑠1 𝑠2\n…\n𝑠𝑛, consisting of characters 0 and 1, and a positive integer 𝑐. Note that in this version of the problem, the string 𝑠 doesn't contain ?. Consider all strings 𝑤 that can be obtained from 𝑠 by replacing all characters ? with characters 0 and 1. Find the smallest value of 𝑓(𝑤)\n among all such strings 𝑤 that is not divisible by 𝑐, or determine that such a string 𝑤 does not exist. Since the answer may be large, find it modulo 10^9+7109+7.\n\n∗\n∗\nThe minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers 𝑐1,𝑐2,…,𝑐𝑘 is defined as the smallest non-negative integer 𝑥 which does not occur in the collection 𝑐.",
  "input_format": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑐 (3≤𝑛≤2⋅10^5, 1≤𝑐≤10^9) — the length of the string and the number that limits the value of the function.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a string of length 𝑛, consisting of characters 0 and 1 — the string 𝑠.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.",
  "output_format": "For each test case, if there exists such a string 𝑤 that can be obtained from 𝑠 by replacing all characters ? with characters 0 and 1, such that 𝑓(𝑤)\n is not divisible by 𝑐, then output the minimum value of 𝑓(𝑤)\n among all such strings 𝑤. The answer should be output modulo 10^9+7109+7. If such a string does not exist, output −1\n−1.",
  "constraints": "In the second test case, there is no suitable string 𝑤, since 𝑓(𝑤)\n is always divisible by 1.\n\nIn the third test case, we can only take 𝑤=𝑠, then 𝑓(𝑤)=4 𝑓(𝑤)\n=4, as there are exactly 4 suitable permutations:\n\n𝑝=[0,2,3,1]\n𝑝=\n[\n0,2,3,1\n];\n𝑝=[0,3,2,1]\n𝑝=\n[\n0,3,2,1\n];\n𝑝=[1,2,3,0]\n𝑝=\n[\n1,2,3,0\n];\n𝑝=[1,3,2,0]\n𝑝=\n[\n1,3,2,0\n]\n.\n\nIn the sixth test case, one can take the string 𝑤=𝟷𝟶𝟶𝟷𝑤=10^001, then 𝑓(𝑤)\n will be equal to 12. One of the suitable permutations is [0,4,3,2,1]\n[\n0,4,3,2,1\n]\n, while, for example, the permutation [0,1,2,3,4]\n[\n0,1,2,3,4\n]\n does not fit. It can be shown that 12 is the smallest value not divisible by 8 that can be obtained.",
